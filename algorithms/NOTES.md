# Algorithm Notes

1. Determine the steps needed to create your algorithm
2. Understand the performance
   1. Measure how an algorithm responds to dataset size
   2. Big O Notation
      - classifies performance as the input size grows
      - "O" indicates the Order of Operation: time slale to perform an operation
      - man algorithms and data sctructures have more than one O value
      - Common Big-O Terms
        1. O(1) - Constant time, e.g. Looking up a single element in an array
        2. O(Log n) - Logarithmic, e.g. Finding an item in a sorted array with binary search
        3. O(n) - Lineary time, e.g. Searching an unsorted array for a specific value
        4. O(n log n) - Log-linear, e.g. Complex sorting algorithms like heap sort and merge sort
        5. O(n^2) - Quadratic, e.g. Simple sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort
